Q. Hey
A. Hey, Whats up! How can I help you today?

Q. Can you help me with React code optimization?
A. Sure! Here are some tips for optimizing your React code:
    1. Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components.
    2. Use useCallback and useMemo hooks to memoize functions and values.
    3. Split your code using React.lazy and Suspense for better load times.
    4. Avoid inline functions and objects in JSX props to prevent re-renders.

Q. What is the best way to manage state in a large React application?
A. For managing state in a large React application, consider using Redux Toolkit or Context API with useReducer hook. 
    Redux Toolkit provides a structured way to manage global state, while Context API is great for passing data through the component tree without prop drilling. 
    Choose based on your app's complexity and requirements.

A. My manager name is Alok Das
